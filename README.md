# Optimising Credit Card Onboarding for Reem Finance

This repository contains the final submission for our ISIT312 project at the University of Wollongong. The project aims to optimize Reem Finance’s credit card onboarding process using a scalable data lake architecture, automated ETL pipelines, and interactive Power BI dashboards.

## 📌 Project Overview

Reem Finance, a financial services provider in the UAE, needed a data infrastructure upgrade to handle increasing volumes of onboarding and transactional data. We redesigned their architecture to:

- Integrate structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- Automate ETL processes with Azure pipelines.
- Enable real-time insights via Power BI.

- ✅ Power BI dashboards for customer segmentation, rewards, transaction trends
- ✅ Real-time validation and credit scoring
- ✅ Compliance with UAE data privacy regulations
